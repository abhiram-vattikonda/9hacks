# 🎮 9hacks

**9hacks** is a Unity-based game developed during a hackathon. It combines engaging gameplay mechanics with stylized graphics to deliver an immersive experience.

You are an adventurer on a quest to collect the broken fragments of a mythical drink. To achieve this, you must conquer four unique mini-games—each granting a relic. Once all relics are gathered, they combine to form a legendary Red Bull can.

This game was developed in just 12 hours during a hackathon by my team and me. It marks our first exploration into advertising through gaming.
